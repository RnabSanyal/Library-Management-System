# Library-Management-System
A one stop website for students and library management. 
Provides students with an easy to use search tool to search for books in the library using book titles or keywords, pre-order books (which basically reserves the particular book for an amount of time for the student) and track the status of their books, i.e. overdue, borrowed or ordered. 
The admin panel is for managing the library(Still under development). 
Developed as a project for college curriculum.
